# MongoDB

### Projected Time
30-45 minutes
- 10 minutes for video walkthrough of slides
- 20 minutes for Independent Practice
- 15 minutes for Check for Understanding

### Prerequisites
- "JS 6 - Object Literals" lesson
- "JSON" lesson
- "Relational Databases" lesson

### Motivation
Not all data can be or should be stored in a relational way. In those cases, it is more efficient to use a NoSQL database ("**N**ot **O**nly **SQL**"). MongoDB is one of the most popular NoSQL databases because it is schemaless and uses JSON-like documents to store data. 
Learning how to use MongoDB for folks who already know JavaScript is easy and the fact that MongoDB stores documents makes it easy to program in.


### Objective
**Students will be able to**
- Set up a MongoDB database on their laptops
- Create databases and collections in MongoDB
- Add, query, and remove documents
- Remove databases and collections

### Materials

- [Webinar: When to Use MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/presentations/webinar-when-use-mongodb)
- [MongoDB University](https://university.mongodb.com/)
- [TutorialsPoint MongoDB Tutorial](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/mongodb/)

### Common Mistakes / Misconceptions

- **"I already learned how to use relational databases. I'll just stick with that. They both store data anyway."** The structure of relational databases is set up for relational data. Using a relational databse for non-relational data results in reduced scalability and added cost.

### Independent Practice

Techtonica staff will assign pairs.

**Activity 1: Installation**
1. Check to see if you have Homebrew installed on your laptop. From your Terminal, run the `brew help` command. If you have Homebrew installed, you'll see output from Homebrew appear in your Terminal.  

If no Homebrew-related text appears, you'll need to install Homebrew. Go to the [Homebrew website](https://brew.sh/). Copy the code snippet that looks like this: `/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"` and paste it into your Terminal. Run the command. Follow the prompts, if necessary, to install Homebrew. Ask for help from Techtonica staff if you need help.

2. To ensure you have the latest version of MongoDB, run `brew update` in the Terminal. This may take a couple minutes.

3. Install MongoDB using `brew install mongodb` in the Terminal. If you get an error message saying you need to install Xcode from the App Store, follow the instructions to do so and then re-try `brew install mongodb`. Ask for help from Techtonica staff if you need help.

--------------
Left off here

- Make sure you have the directory /data/db. If not, run `mkdir -p /data/db`.
- Run `whoami` to find your username. For example, your username is "myname", then you will run the following command `sudo chown myname /data/db`. You may need to enter your password.
- If you'd like to check and see if your has the right permissions add 
``` > sudo chown -R `id -un` /data/db
> # Enter your password ``` 
- Run the Mongo Daemon - in one of your terminal windows run ` mongod ` 
- Run the Mongo Shell - keep your Mongo deaemon running in one window and in one of your other terminal windows run `mongo`,this will allow you to access data in MongoDB.

- To exit the Mongo shell type quit()
- To stop the Mongo daemon hit > ctrl-c 




- If a ~/.bash_profile exist, open it. If not, create one. Enter:
  - `export MONGO_PATH=/usr/local/mongodb`
  - `export PATH=$PATH:$MONGO_PATH/bin`
- Save .bash_profile and restart terminal.
- Open 2 terminal window. On one, run `mongod`. Wait until the following message appear: `[initandlisten] waiting for connections on port 27017`. mongod stands for Mongo Daemon, the host ***process*** for the database. Next, you will open a Mongo shell to ***access*** the database.
- Keep the first window open with `mongod` still running. Switch to second terminal window, run `mongo --host 127.0.0.1:27017`. This is your Mongo shell.

**Activity 2: Working with Database**
- In the shell, run `use techtonica`. Then run `show dbs`, which will list out the list of databases. What database is there? What is missing?

- The newly created database, "techtonica", should be missing. This is because the techtonica database is empty. Insert a document by running `db.classmates.insert({"name": "your_name", "month": your_birthmonth})`. Do it at least two more time with your classmate's name. Remember not to double-quoted the birthmonth to keep it as a digit instead of string.

- MongoDB stores documents in collection. Run `show collections`. What is already there? Can you guess at least where one of the collections came from?

- Run `db.createCollection("teacher")`.

- View what's in each collection by running `db.classmates.find()` and `db.teachers.find()`. What's the difference?

- Fix the empty teacher collection by entering a document: `db.teachers.insert({"teacher": "Erin"})` and `db.teachers.insert({"teacher": "Allard"})`.

- Select a number between your birthmonth and your classmate's birthmonth inside the classmates collections. Run `db.classmates.remove({"month": {$lt: the_number_your_selected}})`. The "$lt" means "less than". What do you think happened to the collections?

- Run `db.classmates.find()`. Were you correct?

- Run `db.teachers.remove({})`, then `db.teachers.find()`. What happened?

- Make sure you are in the techtonica database by running `use techtonica`. Make sure the output is `switched to db techtonica`. Then, you will delete the techtonica database by running `db.dropDatabase()`. The output should be `{ "dropped" : "techtonica", "ok" : 1 }`.

- Exit the shell by running `exit`. Next, go to the terminal window running the Mongo Daemon, mongod. Exit the daemon by entering Ctrl C.

### Challenge

"$lt" was used earlier to filter out which documents you deleted. MongoDB's documentation have a page on [Operators](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/query/). What type of operator is "$lt"?

Operator can be use to not only filter what you remove, but also what you find. For example, `db.classmated.find({"month": {$lt: 6}})` will output any anyone born before July. You will be testing some of it next.

Open up the MongoDB daemon and shell again, create a database named "filterData". Create a collection named "zoo". Create at least 3 documents in the following format: `{"type": "lion", "name": "Suzy", "age": 10}`. Look at MongoDB's Operator page and find at least one operator other than Comparison Operator (which $lt was), and then test it out in the zoo collection.

### Check for Understanding

List out the steps to store data in MongoDB.
 Find a classmate.
  One of you will try to explain the steps by comparing it to organizing books, and the other will compare it to organizing kitchen utensils.
